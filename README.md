    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #555;">
        I'm a passionate <strong>Software Engineering Student</strong> at 
        <em>COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI), Lahore Campus</em>. Currently, I'm in my 
        <strong>7th semester</strong> (as of <span style="color: #007BFF;">August 22, 2024</span>) 
        and eagerly looking forward to graduating in <strong>July 2025</strong>! 🎓
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #555;">
        I absolutely <span style="color: #FF5733;">❤️</span> working on web projects and exploring 
        cutting-edge technologies that make websites visually stunning and highly interactive. 
        While I am a <strong>full-stack developer</strong>, my heart leans more towards the 
        <strong>frontend</strong>. 🌟 I am continually honing my skills and pushing myself to 
        excel in this area.

        My toolkit includes <strong>Vite</strong> for fast development, and I rely on 
        <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and <strong>Chakra UI</strong> for effortless styling. 
        Recently, I've ventured into the world of <strong>UI/UX design</strong> with 
        <strong>Figma</strong> and started incorporating <strong>Spline</strong> for stunning 
        3D objects on the web. 🎨✨
